    <p>
      Homemade breakfast sausage patties made with ground pork, brown sugar, and
      sage deliver sweet and savory flavor in every bite. These are better than
      store-bought since you can flavor them as you like! Serve a patty
      alongside scrambled eggs and hash brown potatoes or layer one with a fried
      egg and a slice of cheese to make a tasty breakfast sandwich.
